      <h2>Metal</h2>
      <p>This element is feminine because metal is extracted from the feminine earth, although metal is considered less feminine than earth or water. Metal’s planet is Venus. Metal’s season is autumn, the time of harvest (with a metal scythe), completion, and the beginning of rest. Metal corresponds to the three earthly branches of fall: Monkey (August), Phoenix (September), and Dog (October). Metal’s direction is west. On the feng shui ba-gua metal correlates to children and creativity. Metal’s symbol is a white Tiger.</P>
      <p>Although metal is a lesser yin element, it can exist in either a yang or a yin state. When metal expresses masculine yang energy, its color is white and is symbolized by a weapon. When metal expresses feminine yin energy, its color is silver and is symbolized by a kettle. Metal qualities include strength, independence, focus, intensity, righteousness, and fluency in speech. The metal personality is very determined and powerful. Metal types succeed by being less opinionated, accepting change, and gracefully releasing the past.</p>

      <h2>Wood</h2>
      <p>Wood is the most human of the elements. It is the element of spring; the creative urge to achieve - which can turn to anger when frustrated. It is associated with the capacity to look forward, plan and make decisions, hence growth and expansion.</p>
      <p>Wood energy is rising, expanding, and is the force of growth and flexibility, hence the colour associated with Wood is green and a rectangled shape.</p>
      <p>This element represents all the activities of the body that are self regulating and/or function without conscious thought; i.e. digestion, respiration, heart beat and basic metabolism.</P>
      <p>The liver (converting food into fuel which is then supplied to the muscles, tendons and ligaments) is associated to the Wood element as well as the gallbladder.</p>
      <p>Wood represents as well the direction East, the planet Jupiter and is symbolized by an Azure Dragon.<p>
      <p>Wood ‘governs’ the Chinese Zodiac signs Tiger, Rabbit and Dragon. </p>

  <h2>Water</h2>
  <p>In Chinese Taoist thought, water is representative of intelligence and wisdom, flexibility, softness, and pliancy; however, an overabundance of the element is said to cause difficulty in choosing something and sticking to it. In the same way, water can be fluid and weak, but can also wield great power when it floods and overwhelms the land. In Chinese medicine, water is believed to govern the kidney and urinary bladder, and is associated with the ears and bones. The negative emotion associated with water is fear/anxiety, while the positive emotion is calmness.</p>

  <h2>Fire</h2>
  <p>On a deeper level, the Fire element expresses itself as joy and manifests within us as love, laughter, and enthusiasm. During summer, the season of maximum expansion, we can become aware of ourselves at our fullest. Drawing on the expansive warmth of Fire we can reach out and relate to the world like a flower opening.</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese recognized the connection among the energetic powers they called Five Elements, and they understood which specific power manifests most strongly in each phase of the cycle of seasons. The special capacity of spring, for example, is the power of birth, as seen in the emergence of new life - the beginning of the growth cycle. Summer holds the power of maturity: In summer, the buds of spring mature into full flowers and now are able to share their pollen to make more flowers. With us, it is the same: Only in the fullness of maturity do we have the inner abundance and self-sufficiency to truly share with others.</p>
